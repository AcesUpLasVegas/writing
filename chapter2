throughout the negativity and the 'new normal' of 2020, I will thrive
and have the greatest year of my life. I understand that I will be very
uncomfortable. I accept it. I embrace it. the pain of learning drives me
toward my goals
The hunger was mounting. I had a severe lust for wealth and a desire for young women.
suddenly: I became aware; and focused my energy on positivity: The healing of the earth, sharing
wealth of knowledge with children, rising above the hate and conducting myself with
poise and compassion. I am worthy of making a difference in this world. I better myself
so that I can help others. I win money at poker and feel no guilt because I am worthy.
I ask for 100k a year salary because I am well worth it, and I will go the extra mile.
I am ready to receive abundance.
