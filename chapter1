Today was a milestone in personal development and acheivement.
Although nothing major happened, I feel a sense of assuredness that I
will acheive all of my goals, as soon as they are nailed down in a fixed
position to focus on.

I am going to become wealthy very soon. I will acheive my poker goals
of winning a major 6 figure score. I will develop applications that
are useful and become a truly successful entrepreneur. I will travel
the world and do what I love to do. I will find someone to share my
life with.
