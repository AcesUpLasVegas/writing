Chapter 3.. the binks kept coming! first I stacked someone in the cash game with AA, then made a straight
flush for a huge 4 way pot. Binked 2 first places in one night and started stacking. The binks and steady
winning sessions kept coming for weeks, just like the summers past, but with even more momentum
I could feel the excitement mounting: it was time to play some online bracelet events and win a major score.
So, I took a shot.....and won a bracelet and 500k! YEAAA WIN A BRACELET!
